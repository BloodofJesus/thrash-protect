Thrash-protect was initially written in late 2013 by Tobias Brox while
working at Redpill-Linpro.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Tobias Brox

Other significant contributors:

    * Unnamed colleague - for setting up swap and not editing the MaxClients setting under apache on a production server running some php application, such that we got downtime due to thrashing - wouldn't have made thrash-protect without this one.
    * Unnamed employee at an unnamed customer - for bypassing our job-scheduling system and running some very memory-intensive processes directly on some of the computing nodes, repeatedly causing nodes to go down due to thrashing.  (thrash-protect eventually did allow his processes to complete, without downtime or further manual work).
