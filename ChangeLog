	* README.md - elaborated a bit on the drawbacks/problems observed
	* thrash-protect.py (thrash_protect): doing a best-effort on running mlockall()

2014-01-14  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* general: version number bump - there shouldn't have been any 0.6.4, it should have been released as 0.7.
	* README.md: some minor docfixes
	* tests/thrash-bot.py: a bit of confusion on what version of this script I actually used when I managed to thrash the system.  At least now it seems to be eating up memory very fast instead of just spinning CPU.

2014-01-13  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* general: bump of version number to 0.6.4 (post-script: this was a mistake - correct version number should have been 0.7).
	* tests/: new directory, unfortunately rather empty
	* tests/thrash-bot.py: improved the thrash-bot, it consumes far less CPU and gobbles far more memory now
	* thrash-protect.py (general): tweaks and bugfixes to handle the new thrash_bot.py.  unfortunately I added lot more complexity. :-(
	* thrash-protect.py (general): debug hooks for randomly stopping processes even if there is no thrashing going on
	* thrash-protect.py (scan_processes): modified from logic to find the process with most pagefaults to "meta-logic" selecting an algorithm for finding which process to stop.
	* thrash-protect.py (scan_processes_pagefaults): old logics from scan_processes
	* thrash-protect.py (scan_processes_pagefaults): various bugfixes
	* thrash-protect.py (scan_processes_pagefaults): added a threshold to make it less likely whitelisted processes will be stopped
	* thrash-protect.py (scan_processes_oom_score): new function to select the process with highest oom_score
	* thrash-protect.py (find_last_unfrozen_process): returns the pid of the last unfrozen process, if it's still running

2013-12-26  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* general: bump of version number to 0.6.3; only "meta"-changes (Makefile, etc)
	* general: successfully created a .deb-package that has been deployed on ubuntu precise
	* INSTALL.md: new file - extracted the practical information out from all the blah-blah in README.md
	* README.md: even more blah-blah - now information on the alternatives to thrash-protect
	* Makefile: quite some bugfixes and work
	* debian/*: debianization.
	* systemv/thrash-protect: bugfix to get correct return code from "status"
	* puppet/: puppet setup

2013-12-20  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* general: bumping version number to 0.6
	* thrash-protect.py: Major fix - changed from using the "major page fault"-counter to using the "page swap in" and "page swap out" counters.  Bidirectional swap or more than 100 pages in/out during a one second interval will trigger process suspension.
	* thrash-protect.py: Made symmetry between the blacklisting and whitelisting; it's done by weighting instead of "stop this process first" or "don't stop this process".
	* thrash-protect.py: Minor bugfix - unfrozen processes didn't get logged properly due to a ProcessLookupFailure when running CONT on the session or group id.
	* puppet/: includes an erb-template for a nrpe config file, though might not work outside our puppet environment (depends on $nagios::nrpe::nagios_plugin_dir to be set)

2013-12-19  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* thrash-protect.py: made support for --version at python2.7 and up, and split out the main logic into a subroutine.
	* rpm: work in progress to build rpm files
	* systemv: work in progress to build a working init-script
	* archlinux/Makefile: allow for automatic build of PKGBUILD and upload to AUR
	* Makefile: Working on release-management through Makefile; ideally all the work involved with making a release should be handled by a simple make command.  Pardon for all the stupid mini-releases, need to do quite some testing here.
	* ChangeLog: Now with a ChangeLog file.  The entries will be used for the commit message when doing releases.

2013-09-06  Tobias Brox  <tobias@redpill-linpro.com>
	* thrash-protect.py: Got a mostly working prototype here - it has been tested in production, and it seems to do what it promises, and I'm happy with it, maybe the initial plan rewriting it in C is not really needed.

	* General: initial commit
